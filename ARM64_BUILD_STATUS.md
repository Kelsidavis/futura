# ARM64 Futura OS Build Status - Raspberry Pi 5

## Overview
This document tracks the progress toward building Futura OS for ARM64 (Raspberry Pi 5) and deployment to a bootable USB device.

## Completed Work

### 1. Fixed Compilation Errors
- **Context Macro Conflict** - Removed `fut_context_switch` macro from `include/arch/arm64/context.h` that conflicted with the actual assembly function declaration in `include/platform/platform.h`
- **uaccess.c ARM64 Incompatibility** - Wrapped x86_64-specific page table probing code (`pmap_probe_pte`) in conditional compilation, created ARM64 stub that delegates memory validation to the MMU
- **Function Signature Mismatches** - Fixed parameter type mismatches in ARM64 IRQ handlers:
  - `fut_irq_send_eoi()` - Changed parameter from `int` to `uint8_t`
  - `fut_irq_enable()` - Changed parameter from `int` to `uint8_t`
  - `fut_irq_disable()` - Changed parameter from `int` to `uint8_t`
  - `fut_timer_init()` - Changed signature to accept `uint32_t frequency`

### 2. Fixed Duplicate Symbol Issues
- **Conditional Stub Inclusion** - Made `kernel/stubs_missing.c` conditional for x86_64 only
- **ARM64-Specific Stubs** - Added `platform/arm64/arm64_stubs.c` back to ARM64 build to avoid duplicate definitions
- **Resolved Conflicts** - Removed duplicate definitions that were causing linker errors

### 3. Created Deployment Infrastructure
- **Deployment Script** - Created `/tmp/deploy_to_usb.sh` (also at `scripts/deploy_rpi5.sh`) for automated bootable USB creation:
  - Validates /dev/sdd block device
  - Creates 4GB sparse disk image
  - Partitions with MBR: FAT32 boot (1MiB-512MiB), ext4 root (512MiB-100%)
  - Installs Raspberry Pi 5 boot configuration
  - Copies kernel to boot partition
  - Creates minimal root filesystem structure
  - Deploys to target USB device

## Remaining Work

### Critical Blocker: Missing Kernel Functions
The ARM64 build fails at linking stage due to undefined core kernel functions:

1. **Memory Management** - Not yet implemented for ARM64:
   - `fut_paging_init()` - Page table initialization
   - `fut_mm_*()` functions - Memory management context (partially stubbed in arm64_stubs.c)

2. **Scheduling** - Not yet ported to ARM64:
   - `fut_scheduler_init()` - Scheduler initialization

3. **Interrupt Handling** - Missing platform-specific implementations:
   - `fut_register_irq_handler()` - Should be in platform code
   - `fut_gic_init()` - GIC initialization (declared but not found)

4. **Timer Management** - Missing platform functions:
   - `fut_timer_set_timeout()` - Timer configuration

5. **C Library Functions** - Standard string functions:
   - `strcmp()` - String comparison
   - `strstr()` - Substring search
   - These are used by arm64_dtb.c for device tree parsing

### Architecture of Missing Pieces

The missing functions represent critical kernel subsystems that need proper ARM64 implementations:

```
Kernel Initialization Flow (kernel/kernel_main.c:691-719):
├── fut_paging_init()      [MISSING] - Memory paging setup
├── fut_scheduler_init()    [MISSING] - Task scheduling
├── fut_register_irq_handler() [MISSING] - IRQ setup
├── fut_gic_init()          [MISSING] - ARM Generic Interrupt Controller
└── Device Tree Processing
    ├── fut_dtb_detect_platform() [Needs strcmp, strstr]
    └── fut_rpi_irq_init()
        └── fut_gic_init() [MISSING]
```

## Next Steps to Complete ARM64 Build

### Option 1: Create Minimal Implementations (Recommended for Quick Boot)
1. Create minimal implementations of missing functions that allow boot without full functionality:
   - `fut_paging_init()` - Empty stub (boot without virtual memory)
   - `fut_scheduler_init()` - Empty stub (no preemption)
   - `fut_register_irq_handler()` - Should exist in platform_init.c, investigate missing
   - `fut_gic_init()` - Should be in platform_init.c, needs export

2. Link in C library functions:
   - Add simple implementations of strcmp, strstr to kernel code
   - Or link against musl libc or provide minimal implementations

### Option 2: Full Implementation (Long-term)
1. Port x86_64 memory management to ARM64
2. Implement ARM64-specific page tables and MMU setup
3. Port scheduler to ARM64 context switching
4. Complete GIC driver implementation

## Files Modified
- `/home/k/futura/Makefile` - Conditional stub inclusion
- `/home/k/futura/include/arch/arm64/context.h` - Removed macro conflict
- `/home/k/futura/kernel/uaccess.c` - ARM64 conditional code
- `/home/k/futura/kernel/irq/arm64_irq.c` - Function signature fixes (kept for reference)
- `/home/k/futura/scripts/deploy_rpi5.sh` - USB deployment script

## Git Commits
- `649ad3c` - arm64: Fix ARM64 context macro conflict and uaccess compatibility
- `20273da` - arm64: Conditionally use ARM64 stubs instead of x86_64 stubs

## Build Commands

```bash
# Clean ARM64 build
make clean PLATFORM=arm64
make PLATFORM=arm64 -j4 kernel

# Check for remaining undefined references
make PLATFORM=arm64 -j4 kernel 2>&1 | grep "undefined reference"

# If build succeeds, deploy to USB
sudo bash /tmp/deploy_to_usb.sh /dev/sdd
```
