## 🚀 Overview

Futura OS is a capability-first nanokernel that keeps the core minimal—time, scheduling, IPC, and hardware mediation live in the kernel while everything else runs as message-passing services over FIPC. The current development focus is on building out a practical userland surface so real applications can execute against the kernel primitives.

### Status Snapshot — Updated Nov 5 2025

- **Kernel**: Advanced memory management with COW fork, file-backed mmap, and partial munmap; comprehensive syscall surface (`fork`, `execve`, `mmap`, `munmap`, `brk`, `nanosleep`, `waitpid`, `pipe`, `dup2`).
- **VFS**: Path resolution + RamFS production-ready; file-backed mmap integrated with eager loading; FuturaFS implementation complete with host-side tools.
- **Shell & Userland**: 32+ built-in commands with pipes, redirections, job control, and history; `libfutura` provides crt0, syscall veneers, heap allocator, and formatted I/O.
- **Distributed FIPC**: Host transport and registry daemons stable; remote UDP bridge for distributed communication.
- **Wayland Compositor**: Multi-surface capable with window decorations, drop shadows, damage-aware compositing, and frame throttling.
- **ARM64 Port**: Full multi-process support with 177 syscalls, EL0/EL1 transitions, fork/exec/wait working. **Apple Silicon M2 support** with complete boot infrastructure (AIC, UART, m1n1 payload) and storage stack (RTKit, ANS2 NVMe) ready for hardware testing.

### What's new — Updated Nov 5 2025

**Recent kernel enhancements (Phase 3—Memory Management):**
- **Copy-on-write (COW) fork**: Process creation shares pages between parent and child, copying only on write via page fault handler. Hash table-based reference counting tracks shared pages with optimizations for sole-owner cases. Dramatically reduces fork() memory overhead and enables efficient fork-exec patterns.
- **File-backed mmap**: VFS-backed memory mappings through `fut_vfs_mmap()`. Files are eagerly loaded with vnode reference counting. VMAs track file backing for future demand paging.
- **Partial munmap with VMA splitting**: `munmap()` handles shrinking VMAs from edges or splitting middle sections while preserving file backing.

**Recent userland focus (Shell & utilities):**
- **32+ shell built-in commands**: Comprehensive Unix-like shell with full support for pipes (`|`), input/output redirection (`<`, `>`, `>>`), job control (`&`, `fg`, `bg`), and command history with arrow keys + tab completion.
  - **File operations**: `cat`, `cp` (multi-file), `mv` (atomic rename), `rm` (with `-f`), `touch`, `mkdir` (recursive `-p`), `rmdir`, `ls` (with `-a`, `-l` flags)
  - **Text processing**: `grep`, `wc`, `head`, `tail`, `cut`, `tr`, `sort`, `uniq`, `paste`, `diff`, `tee`
  - **Utilities**: `find`, `echo`, `test`, `[`, `pwd`, `cd`, `clear`, `help`, and more
  - **Stdin support across all tools**: Proper pipeline integration for Unix-style data flow.

**Advanced compositor:**
- **Wayland compositor** with multi-surface support, window decorations, drop shadows, damage-aware partial compositing (>30% speedup), and frame throttling for smooth rendering.
- **FuturaFS host tools**: `mkfutfs` (formats images with configurable segments), `fsck.futfs` (offline integrity checker with repair).

**Kernel & runtime stability:**
- **Scheduler wait queues**: `fut_waitq` delivers blocking semantics for `waitpid`, timers, and future I/O without spinning.
- **Console character device**: `/dev/console` via TTY driver with automatic newline normalization.
- **libfutura**: crt0, syscall veneers, heap allocator backed by `sys_brk`, lightweight `printf` on `write(2)`, and string utilities.

**ARM64 platform bring-up:**
- **177 working syscalls**: Full Linux-compatible ABI (x8=syscall, x0-x7=args) including fork, exec, wait, networking, filesystem, I/O multiplexing, signals, timers, futex, and more.
- **Multi-process support**: Complete fork → exec → wait → exit cycle working with EL0/EL1 context switching.
- **QEMU virt platform**: Exception vectors, GICv2 interrupts, ARM Generic Timer, PL011 UART, physical memory manager (1 GB).
- **Apple Silicon M2 support** (MacBook Pro A2338):
  - **Phase 1 (Boot): ✅ Complete** — Device tree (M1/M2/M3 detection), Apple AIC interrupt controller, Apple UART (s5l-uart), m1n1 payload (Linux ARM64 image format)
  - **Phase 2 (Storage): ✅ Complete** — RTKit IPC mailbox protocol, ANS2 NVMe driver with TCB programming, device tree hardware address parsing
  - **Build system**: `make m1n1-payload` creates bootable Image.gz (200 KiB compressed) for m1n1 bootloader
  - **Ready for hardware testing** — All drivers implemented, awaiting physical MacBook Pro M2
- **Userland runtime**: crt0 for ARM64, syscall wrappers, working demo programs.
- **MMU status**: Currently disabled but kernel fully functional with physical addressing; MMU enablement deferred.

See `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md` and `docs/ARM64_STATUS.md` for deeper dives into the latest changes and platform-specific progress.

Futura currently targets x86-64 as the primary architecture (QEMU/KVM reference builds). The ARM64 port under `platform/arm64/` has achieved full multi-process support with 177 working syscalls and is rapidly approaching parity with x86-64.

## 🔧 Building

### Prerequisites

- GCC/Clang with C23 support
- GNU Make & Binutils
- Rust toolchain (`rustc` + `cargo`) for kernel drivers (`make rust-drivers`)
- QEMU (optional, for kernel ISO boot tests)
- Optional: OpenSSL (`-lcrypto`) if you want to run remote FIPC AEAD tests (auto-skip otherwise)

### Quick Start (host-side libraries & tests)

```bash
# Build host transport library + userland runtime
make -C host/transport
make -C src/user/libfutura
make -C tests

# Run the remote FIPC regression suite (examples)
./build/tests/fipc_remote_loopback
./build/tests/fipc_remote_capability
./build/tests/fipc_remote_aead_toy
./build/tests/fipc_remote_metrics
```

### Kernel (QEMU ISO)

```bash
# Build Rust drivers + kernel + ISO
make rust-drivers
make
cp build/bin/futura_kernel.elf iso/boot/
grub-mkrescue -o futura.iso iso/

# Boot with serial output
qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom futura.iso -serial stdio -display none -m 128M
```

On boot you should see RAM/VMM init, device registration (including `/dev/console`), FIPC bring-up, and bootstrap threads that exercise VFS and the framebuffer user smoke test.

### Desktop Step 2 demo

```bash
# Build + boot the winsrv/winstub loop (enable logs with DEBUG_WINSRV=1)
make DEBUG_WINSRV=1 desktop-step2
```

The QEMU console will show the window server announcing readiness and the stub client drawing its three test rectangles:

```
[WINSRV] ready 800x600 bpp=32
[WINSRV] create 320x200 -> id=1
[WINSRV] damage id=1 rect x=0 y=0 w=320 h=200
[WINSTUB] connected; created surface 1 (320x200)
[WINSTUB] drew 3 rects; bye
```

The stub throttles updates with short sleeps so the damage passes remain visible on hardware-backed framebuffers.

### Wayland compositor demo

Futura includes a mature Wayland server implementation with advanced compositor features:

```bash
# One-time setup: vendor Wayland libraries
make third_party-wayland

# Build and run the Wayland demo
make wayland-step2
```

This builds the full Wayland server (`futura-wayland`) with multi-surface support, window decorations,
drop shadows (configurable radius), damage-aware partial compositing (>30% speedup), and frame throttling.
Client demos (`wl-simple`, `wl-colorwheel`) exercise the server's surface management and rendering.

**Features**:
- **Multi-surface compositing**: Layered surfaces with z-ordering
- **Window decorations & shadows**: With configurable shadow radius
- **Damage-aware updates**: Only recomposite changed regions (>30% speedup in M2)
- **Frame throttling**: Smooth rendering at display refresh rates
- **Backbuffer mode**: Off-screen rendering for advanced effects
- **Premultiplied alpha**: Correct blending with transparency
- **Environment variables** for feature toggle:
  - `WAYLAND_BACKBUFFER=1` – Enable off-screen rendering
  - `WAYLAND_DECO=1` – Window decorations
  - `WAYLAND_SHADOW=1` – Drop shadow rendering
  - `WAYLAND_RESIZE=1` – Window resize support
  - `WAYLAND_THROTTLE=1` – Frame throttling

> **Tip (headful runs)**  
> The Wayland demo expects a linear framebuffer. When launching QEMU manually use either Bochs or
> virtio GPU output, e.g.
>
> ```bash
> qemu-system-x86_64 \
>     -m 512 \
>     -serial stdio \
>     -drive if=virtio,file=futura_disk.img,format=raw \
>     -display gtk \
>     -vga none \
>     -device bochs-display \
>     -kernel build/bin/futura_kernel.elf \
>     -initrd build/initramfs.cpio \
>     -append "XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0 WAYLAND_MULTI=1 \
>              WAYLAND_BACKBUFFER=1 WAYLAND_DECO=1 WAYLAND_SHADOW=1 \
>              WAYLAND_RESIZE=1 WAYLAND_THROTTLE=1 fb-fallback=1"
> ```
>
> Avoid the harness-only `-device isa-debug-exit` flag when running interactively; otherwise QEMU will
> terminate as soon as the kernel finishes the demo.

### Debugging

Enable targeted tracing at build time by defining the relevant flag, for example:

```bash
make CFLAGS+=-DDEBUG_VFS   # verbose VFS path-walker logs
make CFLAGS+=-DDEBUG_VM    # paging / large-page split diagnostics
make CFLAGS+=-DDEBUG_BLK   # block stack + virtio-blk traces
make CFLAGS+=-DDEBUG_NET   # FuturaNet + virtio-net driver traces
```

`DEBUG_BLK` automatically propagates to the Rust virtio-blk driver (`--cfg debug_blk`) so the BAR/capability dumps only reappear when you opt in.

### Rust driver builds

### Filesystem utilities

Run `make tools` to build the host-side helpers under `build/tools/`:

- `mkfutfs` — formats a FuturaFS image. Useful flags:
  - `--segments <N>` control total log segments
  - `--segment-sectors <N>` set sectors per segment
  - `--block-size <bytes>` select on-disk block granularity (default 512)
  - `--inodes <N>` seed the inode high-water mark
  - `--label <text>` stamp the volume label
  Example: `build/tools/mkfutfs futfs.img --segments 64 --segment-sectors 16 --block-size 4096 --label Demo`

- `fsck.futfs` — offline integrity checker/repair tool:
  - `fsck.futfs --device futfs.img --dry-run` reports structural issues without touching the image
  - `fsck.futfs --device futfs.img --repair` rewrites malformed directory streams and refreshes superblock counters
  - Add `--gc` to opportunistically compact directories with heavy tombstone churn

### Crash-consistency harness

`make futfs-crash-test` regenerates a scratch image, forces a compaction panic (`futurafs.test_crash_compact=1`) to simulate power loss, reboots without the flag, then runs `fsck.futfs` in dry-run and repair modes. A `futfs_crash_gc: PASS` banner indicates the loop survived and post-crash metadata is clean.

### Performance harness

- `make perf` boots the kernel with `perf=on`, runs the deterministic IPC/scheduler/block/net microbenchmarks, and saves the summary lines to `build/perf_latest.txt` while streaming console output to the terminal.
- `make perf-ci` reruns the harness and compares the latest results against `tests/baselines/perf_baseline.json`, failing the build if any percentile drifts beyond ±5 %.
- To refresh the baseline after intentional optimisations, inspect `build/perf_latest.txt`, update the JSON with the new steady-state values, and commit both files together.

### Release pipeline

See `docs/RELEASE.md` for the reproducible build + signing workflow (`make repro`, `make release`, `make sbom`, `make sign`, `make metadata`, `make verify`) and integration notes for Cosign/SBOM tooling.

Rust drivers live under `drivers/rust/` and compile to `staticlib` artifacts that the kernel links directly. You can rebuild them without touching the C pieces via:

```bash
make rust-drivers
```

`make clean` tears down both the C objects and the Cargo `target/` directories.

## 🧠 Architecture Highlights

- **Nanokernel core**: Deterministic cooperative scheduler, per-task MMU contexts with COW support, comprehensive syscall surface (fork, execve, mmap, munmap, brk, nanosleep, waitpid, pipe, dup2), and unified FIPC transport.

- **FIPC everywhere**: Same capability-backed message path serves syscalls, GUI surfaces, distributed communication, and remote transports. Host tooling reuses kernel framing logic for testing without hardware.

- **Capability security**: Tokens (handles) accompany every inter-process operation. Rights bitmaps enforce read/write/admin permissions on all kernel objects. Remote transports bind capabilities into HMAC-SHA256 headers to reject mismatches early.

- **Advanced memory management**:
  - Copy-on-write fork() with hash table-based page reference counting and optimizations for sole owners
  - File-backed mmap with vnode tracking (supports future demand paging)
  - Partial munmap with VMA splitting for fine-grained memory control
  - Per-task MMU contexts owning page tables and driving CR3 switches
  - Executable inheritance of clean address spaces with kernel half pre-mapped

- **Scheduler & synchronization**: Cooperative scheduling with wait queues for `waitpid`, timers, and future I/O—no busy-waiting, no preemption overhead.

- **Console + VFS**: `/dev/console` routes to serial with line discipline; RamFS powers the root filesystem; file-backed mmap enables memory-mapped I/O; devfs provides device access.

- **Wayland compositor**: Multi-surface capable with window decorations, drop shadows, damage-aware partial compositing, frame throttling, and premultiplied-alpha blending.

- **Comprehensive shell**: 32+ built-in commands with pipes, I/O redirection, job control, command history, and tab completion—enabling interactive scripting and workflow automation.

- **Userland runtime**: crt0, syscall veneers, malloc backed by kernel heap growth, printf/vprintf stack, FIPC client library, and POSIX compatibility stubs for legacy code.
